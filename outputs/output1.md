The image shows a complex combined plot which consists of boxplots, individual data points overlaid on the boxplots, and possibly annotations for statistical significance. To create a similar plot in Python, you can use libraries such as `matplotlib` and `seaborn`. Here is a step-by-step guide.

1. **Prepare Data**: You would need your data in a structured form, preferably a `pandas` DataFrame with columns representing the different categories and a row for each data point.

2. **Create Basic Boxplot**: Start by plotting the basic boxplot with `seaborn` or `matplotlib`.
    ```python
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns
    import pandas as pd
    
    # Suppose 'df' is your DataFrame with a 'category' column and a 'value' column
    sns.boxplot(x='category', y='value', data=df, palette='Set2')
    ```

3. **Add Data Points**: To add individual data points on top of the boxplot, use the `stripplot` function from `seaborn`.
    ```python
    sns.stripplot(x='category', y='value', data=df, color='gray', jitter=0.2, size=2.5)
    ```

4. **Add Annotations**: The p-values can be added using `matplotlib`'s `text` function.
    ```python
    plt.text(x=0.5, y=0.95, s="p=0.28", ha='center', va='center', transform=plt.gca().transAxes)
    # The x and y coordinates are in axis fraction, which will need to be adjusted for your specific plot.
    ```

5. **Adjust Style**: Tweak the plot's appearance by adjusting the `matplotlib` style settings.
    ```python
    plt.style.use('ggplot') # You can change this to whatever style you prefer
    sns.set_style('whitegrid')
    ```

6. **Set Axes Labels & Title**: Set the labels for the axes and the plot title.
    ```python
    plt.xlabel('Your X-axis Label')
    plt.ylabel('Your Y-axis Label')
    plt.title('Your Plot Title')
    ```

7. **Handle Legend**: Modify legend if necessary.
    ```python
    plt.legend(title='Legend Title', loc='upper left')
    ```

8. **Show or Save Plot**: Display the plot on screen or save it to a file.
    ```python
    plt.show()
    # Or save to a file
    plt.savefig('myplot.png', dpi=300)
    ```

To match the exact styling, colors, and arrangement in your given image, you would need to closely tweak the parameters, sizes, colors, and possibly use other `matplotlib` functions to add elements such as the error bars, brackets, or custom annotations. The above steps give you the general framework to start with, and with iterative customization, you can refine your plot to resemble the one in the image.
