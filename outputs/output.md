The figure you provided appears to be a type of box plot with overlaid scatter points for individual data points, which is often used to illustrate the distribution of a dataset. You can create a similar plot using Python's `matplotlib` library along with `seaborn`, which is a statistical plotting library built on top of `matplotlib` that provides a higher-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

Here's a step-by-step example on how to create a similar plot using these libraries:

1. Import the necessary libraries:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```

2. Create or load your dataset. For demonstration purposes, I'll create a sample dataframe with random data:

```python
# Creating a sample dataframe with random data
np.random.seed(10)
data = {
    'Harvard-RT1': np.random.rand(136),
    'Harvard-RT2': np.random.rand(387),
    'RTOG-0617': np.random.rand(403),
    'NSCLC-radiogenomics': np.random.rand(142),
    'LUNG-PET-CT-Dx': np.random.rand(307)
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Create 'Category' and 'Value' columns for melting the dataframe
df_melted = df.melt(var_name='Category', value_name='Value')
```

3. Create the box plot with overlaid scatter plots:

```python
# Set the style of seaborn
sns.set_style("whitegrid")

# Size of the figure
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))

# Create a box plot
ax = sns.boxplot(x='Category', y='Value', data=df_melted, palette="Set3")

# Overlay individual data points
sns.stripplot(x='Category', y='Value', data=df_melted, color='black', alpha=0.5, jitter=True, size=4)

# Improve the visualization
plt.xticks(rotation=45) # Rotate category labels if needed
plt.tight_layout() # Adjust the plot to ensure everything fits without overlap

# Add annotations, titles, etc.
plt.title('Example Box Plot with Individual Data Points')
```

4. (Optional) Add statistical annotations as seen on your figure:

You would probably need to calculate the p-values based on your statistical tests and then annotate the figure accordingly. Here's an example of how you could add text annotations:

```python
# Example of adding p-values; you would substitute actual p-values and their respective positions
plt.text(0.5, 0.9, "p=0.28", ha='center', va='center', transform=ax.transAxes)
plt.text(1.5, 0.9, "p<0.0001", ha='center', va='center', transform=ax.transAxes)
# ... Add more annotations as required
```

5. Show or save the plot:

```python
# Display the plot
plt.show()

# Or save the plot to a file
# plt.savefig('boxplot_with_points.png', dpi=300)
```

Please note that you will need to adapt the code to fit your actual dataset and you might need to perform statistical tests to annotate the figure with p-values based on your data.
